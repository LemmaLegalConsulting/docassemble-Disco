1,"Counsel must work with the client to collect responsive information to answer all nonobjectionable interrogatories (or the parts of interrogatories that are not objectionable). The responder has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to obtain responsive information and to provide information from all sources under its control. (Regency Health Servs., Inc. v. Super. Ct. (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1496, 1504.) Because of the duty to investigate, a responding party may not simply state that it lacks personal knowledge to answer an interrogatory. It must make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information by inquiring with other persons and organizations, unless the information is equally available to the propounding party.

2,"The duty to answer interrogatories extends beyond personal knowledge. If a party lacks personal knowledge sufficient to respond fully, the party must make “a reasonable and good-faith effort to obtain the information” from other sources. (CCP § 2030.220(c); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 406.) For example, the responding party must obtain and disclose information from sources under its control (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 782), as well as information in its counsel's possession. (Smith v. Super. Ct.

The entity must gather information necessary to answer the interrogatories from all sources under its control, even if the information is not personally known to the designated officer or agent.

If the responding party cannot answer an interrogatory completely, it must answer to the extent possible. (CCP § 2030.220(b).) An incomplete or evasive answer that provides only a portion of the information sought is improper and may subject the responding party to a motion to compel and sanctions.

This standard gives the propounding party a broad right to discovery. (CCP § 2017.010; Williams v. Super. Ct. (2017), 3 Cal.5th 531, 541.) Any doubts about discoverability are resolved in favor of disclosure. (See Williams, 3 Cal.5th at 542.) “California’s pretrial discovery procedures are designed to minimize the opportunities for fabrication and forgetfulness, and to eliminate the need for guesswork about the other side’s evidence, with all doubts about discoverability resolved in favor of disclosure.” (Glenfed Dev. Corp. v. Super. Ct. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1119.) To accomplish the legislative purpose behind the discovery statutes, they “must be construed liberally in favor of disclosure.” (Emerson Elec.

15,"If discovery responses contain anything aside from objections, the responding party must verify the responses under oath by declaring that the party has read the interrogatories and that the responses are true based on the party's knowledge.

Objection based on ambiguity is only appropriate if the question is wholly unintelligible. (xxxxx.) An interrogatory must be answered if “the nature of the information sought is apparent.” (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 783.) Even where there are material typos in an interrogatory, where responder's counsel can fairly assume the intended meaning, the responder should answer with the assumed meaning.

19,"An objection that an interrogatory response would be ""burdensome,"" by itself, is not a valid basis for objection: the ground for objection is “oppression.” Thus, it is not enough that the questions will require a lot of work to answer. It must be shown that the burden of answering is so unjust that it amounts to oppression. (West Pico Furniture Co. of Los Angeles v. Sup.Ct. (Pacific Finance Loans), supra, 56 C2d at 417-418, 15 CR at 124] In determining whether the burden is unjust, a weighing process is required: It must appear that the amount of work required to answer the questions is so great, and the utility of the information sought so minimal, that it would defeat the ends of justice to require the answers. [See Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Rolfe) (1968) 263 CA2d 12, 19, 69 CR 348, 352; and West Pico Furniture Co. of Los Angeles v. Sup.Ct.
